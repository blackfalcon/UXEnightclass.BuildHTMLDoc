    <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Though killer whales, also called orcas, are considered whales by most people, they are actually members of the Delphinidae (dolphin) family. Killer whales are excellent hunters that a wide range of prey, including fish, seals, and big whales such as blue whales. Despite their hunting of other animals, free-ranging killer whales have never been reported killing a human being.<p>

        <p>Orcas have long, rounded bodies with large dorsal fins at the middle of their backs. Their black bodies are marked with white patches on the underside and near the eyes. The average male orca grows to 23 feet long and weighs 7 to 10 tons. Females average 21 feet long and weigh 4 to 6 tons.Orcas live 30 to 50 years in the wild.</p>

        <p>Like dolphins, orcas use echolocation - bouncing sound off of objects to determine their location - to hunt and use a series of high-pitched clicks to stun prey. Orcas feed on fish, squid, birds, and marine mammals. Orca pods often work together to catch a meal. Pods sometimes will force many fish into one area and take turns feeding or will beach (slide out of the water onto the shore) themselves to scare seals or penguins into the water where other whales are waiting to feed.</p>

        <p>Orca gestation is 13 to 16 months. A calf is born in autumn weighing almost 400 pounds and measuring up to 7 feet in length. A calf will remain with its mother for at least two years.</p>

        <h2>10 interesting facts about Orcas:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Orcas are found in all the worldâ€™s oceans.
            </li>
            <li>
                Orcas are apex predators and lack any natural predators.
            </li>
            <li>
                Most males never leave their mothers.
            </li>
            <li>
                Orcas have culture since their hunting techniques and vocalizations are passed down generations.
            </li>
            <li>
                Orcas generate 3 types of sounds: clicks, whistles, and pulsed calls.
            </li>
            <li>
                Each pod has its own dialect of calls (that only they use).
            </li>
            <li>
                Orcas and pilot whales are the only non-human species in which females undergo menopause (around age 40 years) and live decades after.
            </li>
            <li>
                There may be up to 4 generations of Orcas in a traveling group.
            </li>
            <li>
                Orcas have the 2nd heaviest brain among marine mammals (sperm whales have the heaviest brain)
            </li>
            <li>
                A female Orca gives birth to 1 calf every five years, and she averages 5 calves per lifetime.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </aside>
    <h3>Dangers</h3>
        <p>Recent studies have found that orcas are among the most contaminated marine mammals in the world. Pollution and chemical contamination make orcas more susceptible to disease and likely cause reproductive difficulties. In addition, Orcas are among the most intelligent species in the world, making them particularly unsuitable to captivity.</p>
